## Who am I?

<br />

I am a **civil engineer**, worked in the field for 1.5 years, specifically in front-end development. I've always been interested in technology, so I decided to learn it on my own.

<br />

## So how it all started?

<br />

It was summer of 2021, during covid. I got interested in coding. I was very frightened about the taking this decision cause of what I read in that time about other people's journey and how some just ditched the journey and went back to their old jobs. Nonetheless, I decided to keep going with the plan. After my decision was made, I started learning how to code.

<br />

My journey started on November, I knew that I needed to look for good resources to learn from. Some resources popped up on my screen and I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). After spending the first month learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found about the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which was another resource to keep practicing and learning. I started with the Odin Project and I was able to finish most of the courses.

<br />

When I found out that I was able to get my hands on React I discovered [Scrimba's React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). Completed the whole course and fall in love with React's ecosystem. I was able to build a couple of projects with React. After that all pieces of the puzzle started to fit.

<br />

## What's next?

<br />

After finishing the Odin Project and Scrimba's React course, I decided it was time to look for a job. I started applying to different job posts and I got a couple of interviews, until I got a position as a **Frontend Developer**. I was very excited that I could land a job in a complete new field. I'm looking forward to keep learning and growing as a developer.
